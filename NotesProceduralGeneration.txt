Procedural Generation Techniques in games

First tool{
	Constructive Method
		Spelunky level generation algorithm
		AD&D Dungeon Generation system.
		
		Piece together random blocks
		Direct rand via
			Knowledge rep
			Altering dist
			Indirect, lookup tables.
		"Let's just hack something together."
		Customized to the design of specific game.
		Simple to author customization
		repetitiveness
	Grammars
		Build something that builds something that builds something.
		Specify ontology, axioms, set of production rules.
		Rules determine how symbols are expanded.
		L-Systems.
		Quests, dungeons, caves, etc...
		Power - easy to author chunks of content, surprisingly complex structures.
		over- and under generating.
		design guarantees declarative
		translating to constraints is difficult.
		debugging is painful
	Constraint-Based Systems
		Build something, stop when you hit a point.
		Variation Forever
		Educational puzzle game called Refraction
		Define domain in terms of variables and numerical and/or logical constraints.
		Off-the shelter solver.
		"I need to meet hard design constraints and I love logic programming."
		Specify what you WANT, what you DON'T WANT.
		need to express entire domain in logic. 
		Can make promises about design issues.
			Solvability/ validity.
			Player experience.
		Flexible, general-purpose.
		Scalability depends on domain representation
		Debugging is difficult.
	Optimization
		City Conquest
		Yavalath
		Angelina: generates complete games.
		
		Also known as search-based PCG
		Use an evolutionary algorithm to evolve the content.
		Fitness function: "goodness" of content
			Difficult
		Representation: creates a search space where good content can be found.
		Quite a lot of sophistication.
		Extremely general, requires little domain knowledge, finds unexpected solutions
		Can be very slow.
		Scalable - from creating new rules to creating new games.
	
	
	Mix-and-Match
		Optimization and grammars
		Constraints and grammars
		Optimization and constraints
		multi-layer constructive.

	What do you care about?
		Building Blocks
			Authored Chunks/Pre-made bits.
			Templates
			Components
			Subcomponents
		Game Stage
			Online
			Offline
			RealTime
		Player Interavtion
			None
			Paramaterized
			Indirect
			Direct
		Design Control
			Indirect
			Compositional
			Experiential
	Data Vs Process
		Where do you place authorial control?
			Authored Chunks/Template - 
				Data oriented.
				good with Grammars
			Components/Subcomponents - 
				Process Oriented
				Fitting a Designer/Artist into an algorithm.
				good with Evolutionary Algorithm or Constraint based systems.
	Algorithm Speed
		Online/Real Time
			Speed is paramount
			Human-In-The-Loop
			Grammars, Constructive Systems, SOME Constraint systems.
		Offline
			Flexible in algorithm choice
			Automated Curation
	What About The Players?
	Type of control dictates algorithm choice.
		None
		paramaterized
		Indirect
		Direct 
		Indirect
		Compositional
		Experiential

Caves of Qud{
	state machines
		Slider between war and peace?
	grammars
		political representation
			Dictatorship
			Democracy
			Republic
	"Then we discuss the system’s salient features, including 
		the lack of expected causality, 
		the parameterization of historical events, 
		the emergence of coherent narratives, 
		event branching, and 
		the use of a replacement grammar to generate historical description."
	Example: 
		Acting against #injustice#, #sultanName# led an
		army to the gates of #location#.
			When determining how to replace #injustice#, the event examines
			the sultan’s properties for meaningful state. If, for instance 
			the sultan has any allied animal factions—say, frogs—#injustic# 
			may be replaced with “the persecution of frogs”. In this way, 
			the event’s effect precedes its cause. When the sultan’s state 
			fails to produce a suitable cause, the event can even create one
			by, say, altering the sultan’s allied factions property to 
			include frogs and performing the substitution described above. 
			In these cases there’s a full reversal of the expected causality
			; the effect causes the cause.

	Methods
		perpetual reformation of universe state/goals.
		forward-chaining(from events to consequences)
		backward-chaining(from goals to current state)
		planning Stage
			keeps track of a set of pending goals which drive the expansion of a partial draft of the story until a complete plot is obtained.

			work either backwards towards current state or forwards towards goal state

			Character goals - what the characters in the story want to do.
			no goals - deterministic universe.
				Things happen because _, _, ..., and _ happened.
		Intent-Driven Partial Order Causal Link (IPOCL)
			simultaneously reasoned about causality and character [deliberation/purposive-ness] and motivation in order to produce narrative sequences that are causally coherent (in the sense that they drive towards a conclusion) (→ Coherence) and have elements of character believability. 
			Fabulist first generates a narrative plan that meets the outcome objective, ensuring that all character actions and goals are justified by events within the narrative itself.
